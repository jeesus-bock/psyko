# psyko

A very experimental project investigating Go TCL integration.

Dynamic end-point generation based on available script files. The available
ones ought to be advertised on some general end-point maybe.

Yes, it doesn't make much sense, but I had just finished another project
and was bored and started playing around with Gin some more. The general
plan is that there is no plan.

### Front-end

Testing out AlpineJS again, I'm sort of tired of heavvy-duty fe systems and here
we don't have any sort of hard requirements so mightaswell experiment.

### Other functionality
I also want persistence propably sqlite, but I want to make it accessible from
the tcl scripts and mainly the scripts.
