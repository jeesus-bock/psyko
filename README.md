# psyko

A very experimental project investigating Go TCL integration.

Dynamic end-point generation based on available script files. The available
ones ought to be advertised on some general end-point maybe.

Yes, it doesn't make much sense, but I had just finished another project
and was bored and started playing around with Gin some more. The general
plan is that there is no plan.
